# Movie Trailer Website

This python web page was created by Orlando Viera for Project 1 of the Full
Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

The files can be found 
[here](https://github.com/oviera5/FSND_P1).

You will need to have Python 2 loaded on your system in order to run the
application.

Copy media.py, entertainment_center.py, and fresh_tomatoes.py to your 
local drive, and enter 'python entertainment_center.py' within your terminal.

An HTML file, fresh_tomatoes.html, will be created and will load
to your default browser. Once the web page is loaded, you will be able to
click links to view trailer of the posted movies.
